# Asteroids
Browser game made in JavaScript for practicing many of the important aspects of the language

The goal of the game is to shoot lasers at the asteroids so that they split up into smaller pieces until they are finally destroyed.
Each asteroid you hit, depending on its size, will give you score which you will keep accumulating until you run out of your 3 lives.
Once you have run out of lives the score is reset and if you beat the current highscore it will be saved for future attempts.

The difficulty of the game will keep ramping up as you clear levels of asteroids, **can you save your spaceship**?
